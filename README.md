# atom-language-modelica3

This package was created using an automatic conversion  
`Sublime Text -> TextMaker -> Atom.io`

The original Sublime Text package is here:  
https://github.com/BorisChumichev/modelicaSublimeTextPackage  
All credits for creating that package go to [@BorisChumichev](https://github.com/BorisChumichev).  
When filing an [issue here](../../issues),
you should consider filing an [issue there](https://github.com/BorisChumichev/modelicaSublimeTextPackage/issues), too.

For the first conversion step  
`Sublime Text -> TextMaker`  
the ant script and XML/XSL files from  
https://github.com/srbs/textmate-to-sublime-converter  
were used.  
Credits for that conversion script go to [@srbs](https://github.com/srbs).

The second conversion step  
`TextMaker -> Atom.io`  
can be done using the Atom.io package manager `apm`.

A step-by-step guide can be found here:

At some later point, I might submit this package to the Atom.io package index  
https://atom.io/packages  
To use this package today,
you can just copy the content of this repo to you Atom packages directory:
```
cd ~/.atom/packages  
git clone https://github.com/thorade/atom-language-modelica3
```
